        <p class="parBurung"><b>Columbidae</b> is a bird family constituted of pigeons and doves. These are stout-bodied
            birds with short necks, and short slender bills that in some species feature fleshy ceres. They primarily
            feed on seeds, fruits, and plants. The family occurs worldwide, but the greatest variety is in the
            Indomalaya and Australasia ecozones.</p>

            The <b>white-eyes</b> are small passerine birds native to tropical, subtropical and temperate Sub-Saharan
            Africa,
            southern and eastern Asia, and Australasia. White-eyes inhabit most tropical islands in the Indian Ocean,
            the western Pacific Ocean, and the Gulf of Guinea. Discounting some widespread members of the genus
            Zosterops, most species are endemic to single islands or archipelagos. The silvereye, Zosterops lateralis,
            naturally
            colonised New Zealand, where it is known as the "wax-eye" or tauhou ("stranger"), from 1855. The silvereye
            has also been introduced to the Society Islands in French Polynesia, while the Japanese white-eye has been
            introduced
            to Hawaii.</p>
